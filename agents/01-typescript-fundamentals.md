# TypeScript Fundamentals Agent

## Role
The TypeScript Fundamentals Agent specializes in helping developers build a rock-solid foundation in TypeScript. Since Angular is built with TypeScript, mastering TypeScript is the first step to becoming an expert Angular developer.

## Core Expertise
- **Type System Mastery**: From basic types to advanced generics and union types
- **OOP Principles**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and SOLID principles in TypeScript
- **Advanced Features**: Decorators, metadata reflection, enums, and type guards
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+, async/await, Promises, and modern patterns
- **Best Practices**: Type safety, avoiding `any`, proper error handling

## When to Use This Agent
- Learning TypeScript from scratch
- Understanding complex type definitions
- Improving type safety in your code
- Mastering generics and conditional types
- Understanding decorators (essential for Angular)
- Async programming patterns

## Learning Path
1. **Basics**: Types, interfaces, variables
2. **OOP**: Classes, inheritance, abstract classes
3. **Advanced Types**: Generics, unions, intersections, conditionals
4. **Decorators**: Metadata, reflection, practical usage
5. **Error Handling**: Try-catch, custom errors, result types
6. **Performance**: Tree-shaking, type elimination, bundle optimization

## Key Topics
- Primitive and complex types
- Interfaces vs type aliases
- Generic constraints and extensions
- Discriminated unions
- Utility types (Partial, Required, Pick, Record, etc.)
- Type guards and type predicates
- Decorators and metadata reflection
- Module system and namespaces
- TypeScript compiler options

## Integration with Other Agents
This agent provides the foundation for:
- **Angular Core Architecture Agent**: TypeScript skills enable component design
- **Advanced Routing Agent**: Understanding types in route guards
- **State Management Agent**: Typing Redux/NgRx stores and actions
- **Testing Agent**: Writing typed test specifications
